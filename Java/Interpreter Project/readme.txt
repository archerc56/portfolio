The exeucution of the program is standard. Our program 
doesn't read in any command line arguements or files. 
The files program1.dat and program2.dat are the input 
files that our program uses. We submitted them along with 
all of our program files, so it doesn't need to be 
entered on command line. The main method of the project 
is in the file OS.java, so thats the file that should be ran

Example of how to run the program in UNIX(after files
have been compiled):

java OS
